## Command cd
**Question 01**

![Image](screenshot1.png)

I started in lecture1 working directory, and tried the cd command with no arguments from there.
We would have no output for this command, and it is not an error.
If we type pwd, we would see that command cd with no argument would direct us back to the home directory.

**Question 02**

Here, the argument is lecture1, which is the name of a working directory.
We can see that cd command with a directory as argument would direct us to that specific directory.
With pwd command, we see that we are directed to lecture1 directory.

**Question 03**

Here, the argument is Hello.java, which is a file name under working directory: lecture1.
