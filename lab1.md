## Command cd
**Question 01**

![Image](screenshot1.png)

I started in lecture1 working directory, and tried the cd command with no arguments from there.
We would have no output for this command, and it is not an error.
If we type pwd, we would see that command cd with no argument would direct us back to the home directory.

**Question 02**

Wokring directory: home
Here, the argument is lecture1, which is the name of a working directory.
We can see that cd command with a directory as argument would direct us to that specific directory.
With pwd command, we see that we are directed to lecture1 directory.

**Question 03**

Working directory: lecture1
Here, the argument is Hello.java, which is a file name under working directory: lecture1.
In this case, the file can be found, but cd command cannot work with a file.
Thus, system would print "Not a directory", as an error message

In another scenario, the argument is zh-cn.txt, which is a file under message directory, not the working directory we are in right now (lecture1).
In this case, it cannot find the file, nor a directory, and it would print out "No such file or directory" as an error message.

In summary, the output would be an error, because cd command can only be used on directories, not on files.
