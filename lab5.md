## Part 2 – Reflection
One thing I learnt from lab in this second half of quarter is the Java Debugger(jdb) in Week8. I find it cool and useful as it allows users to test the program, edit from the command line, and find potential bugs in the program. Once we type in the compile and run command of jdb, we can enter a "debugging shell" in the terminal that allows us to freely enter commands to design our own specific debugging program. Here, `stop at` stops the program after certain line, `run` initializes jdb and gives us the output of tests. From those output information, we can deduce what is potentially going wrong in the program. What is more, we can further type in `locals` to get all values of current local values, or `print` to print out certain variable's value. These are commands that can give us further knowledge on the program and help us find the bug more efficiently.
