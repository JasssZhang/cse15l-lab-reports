Here, once I've stored my public ssh key within the .ssh directory on my remote account, I was asked to enter my password. When I try to log in after this, I was able to log in directly, without being asked for a password.


## Part 3
In week 2 lab, I've learnt that I can connect my laptop to another computer by using the command *ssh user@ieng6.ucsd.edu*, which I did not know before. By using this command and typing in my student account password upon log in, I was able to connect my laptop to a computer in CSE basement that would act as a server to run any commands that I run on my own laptop. 

I've also learnt that we can write codes to create a webpage, and we can access certain paths and codes with the url bar on our browser. By changing the url and entering certain commands encoded in the code block, we would be able to run the program accordingly and edit the webpage itself.
